//1. In Matrix or Grid questons always follow this method of row instead of i and col instead of j.
//2. Num of rows = grid.length and num of cols = grid[0].length.
//3. Each value of the grid is called cell.
var islandPerimeter = function (grid) {
  let perimeter = 0;
  for (let row = 0; row < grid.length; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < grid[0].length; col++) {
      if (grid[row][col] === 1) {
        //Check for cell with value 1
        perimeter += 4;
        //Note - row > 0 because we are not going to check for 0th row since there will be nothing on top of 0th row
        if (row > 0 && grid[row - 1][col] === 1) {
          //also check whether that cell has another cell on its top with value 1
          perimeter -= 2;
        } //Note - row > 0 because we are not going to check for 0th col since there will be nothing on left of 0th col
        if (col > 0 && grid[row][col - 1] === 1) {
          //or another cell on its left with value 1. Note that this is the reason why we have used nested if condition for top and left inside ln.12
          perimeter -= 2; //If so then substract 2 Since both cells would have counted this shared edge therefore we subtract 2 from the perimeter (one for each cell's redundant count).
        }
      }

  return perimeter;
};
//Note - This approach efficiently calculates the perimeter by only considering the top and left neighbors. The right and bottom neighbors will be accounted for when those cells are processed later in the iteration.
