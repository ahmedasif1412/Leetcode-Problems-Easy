*** Very Important -  When we are doing [i+1] in a for loop iterating over a string or an array then chances are that we would get an undefined since i+1 will cross the limit of the index of the string or the array that you are using but we shouldn't care about it if we are using if conditional statement inside the for loop and also comparing i+1 element before doing any operations with i+1 element.
